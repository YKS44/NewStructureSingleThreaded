 * This is a simple interface that can be used to store methods into a variable. 
 * We had to create a custom one since the built-in functional interface, Consumer, does not support varargs (or the ... thing that allows multiple parameters)
 * 
 * Interfaces can essentially be used for two things: serve as a structural basis of a class or used as a collection of methods whose actions are determined on instantiation.
